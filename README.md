**SFTP_Via_WinSCP**

This script requires WinSCP to be installed wherever the script is ran. 

Your system must have "C:\Program Files (x86)\WinSCP\WinSCPnet.dll". If this .dll is located elsewhere, simply update the PowerShell script to reflect the appropriate path:
	Import-Module "%yourPathHere%"
