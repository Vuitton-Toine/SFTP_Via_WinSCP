**SFTP_Via_WinSCP**

This script can be configured to monitor a folder and SFTP any files to a SFTP server. It will not same the same file twice. This script is preferably ran through Windows Task Scheduler; however, can could also use a `while ($true)` loop to continuously have the script run. 

This script requires WinSCP to be installed wherever the script is ran.  

Requirements: 
1. Your system must have "C:\Program Files (x86)\WinSCP\WinSCPnet.dll". If this .dll is located elsewhere, simply update the PowerShell script to reflect the appropriate path:
	Import-Module "%yourPathHere%"

2. You must define the following script variables to fit your needs: 
	`$WinSCP_SessionOptions` 
	`$sftp_paths` 

3. This script requires that you encrypt your SFTP credentials to an credential file running the command below. Enter the path to the credential file in the script's variable $WinSCP_SessionOptions.UserName & $WinSCP_SessionOptions.Password. This is more secure than storing the credentials in plain-text within the script. 
	`Get-Credential | Export-Clixml -path "C:\creds.txt" -Verbose`
